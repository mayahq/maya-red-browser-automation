<dl class="message-properties">

    <dt>selector<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The xpath for the element to click on. We recommend watching <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhG__BL8zFo'>this video</a> to learn
        more about xpaths (it's slightly long, but its worth it).
    </dd>

    <dt>timeout <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The amount of time in milliseconds that the node will wait for the target element to load in page. Whenever the element is
        loaded, the click action is performed immediately. If it doesn't load within this time period, the node will error out.
    </dd>

    <dt>tabId <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The unique tab id in which the website to be queried is rendered in. It can be obtained in using 
        <code> {"url":"*://*.[domain]/*"}</code> in the <code>find tab</code> node.
        For e.g. 
        <code>{"url":"*://*.[domain]/*"}</code> where domain can be anything like <code>google.com</code> or <code>amazon.in</code>.
        There are other query elements which can be added to same object as referenced above. One common one to be used is for <code>
        activeTab</code> which takes in a <code>boolean</code> to search for a tab in focus with the url pattern matching above.
    </dd>

    <dt>index <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The index of the element to click on, in case your xpath query resolves to multiple elements. If sure that your query
        will always resolve to a unique element, just set this to 0.
    </dd>

    <dt>session <span class="property-type">config</span></dt>
    <dd>
        Holds the encryption keys used by Maya to securely talk to your browser.
    </dd>
